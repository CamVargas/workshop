## About W++

W++ is an open-source mentorship community for women and non-binary individuals in tech. Over the last 40 years, there has been a steady decline of womxn continuing to work in the tech industry but with the aid of effective mentorship programs, we believe we can support our people to stay and have fruitful careers. We do not prescribe how mentorship should be done. We go along with you on your journey and provide resources and support along the way. W++ creates a network of quality connections to support each otherâ€™s growth.
