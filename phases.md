# Phases of the Journey

Just like how software is iterated upon via refactors, new features, and bug fixes, your career is a series of phases repeated over and over again. Continual improvement.

There are four phases:

* Phase 1: Hitting a wall
* Phase 2: Resourcing & analysis
* Phase 3: Actionable next steps
* Phase 4: Iteration & execution

## Phase 1
