# W++ Workshop Worksheet

Use this to detail how you relate to the [four phases](./phases.md).

## Phase 1: Hitting a Wall

Detail below what feelings you're having related to solving an unsolvable problem. For example, "I don't know what to do to get ahead at work right now".

## Phase 2: Resourcing & analysis

Talk to your group about what's going on Phase 1. The group can support you by speaking on their experience and giving recommendations. Write these down. Also add here any online resource, organizations, etc. that will help you.

## Phase 3: Actionable next steps

Spend some time looking through your notes in Phase 2. What are some things you can act on immediately? What is your long-term goal and how will these short-term steps help you achieve that?

## Phase 4: Iteration & execution

Try it out! Look ahead in your calendar and prepare for opportunities to test out what you've come up with in Phase 3. Use this space to document your progress, and use the W++ community to help support you in rapidly iterating on your execution!
